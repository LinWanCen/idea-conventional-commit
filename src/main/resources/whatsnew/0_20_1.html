  <h1>Apologies</h1>
  <p>
    Many of you probably asked themselves why I haven't been updating this plugin as frequently as I did in the past.
  </p>
  <p>
    Well, long story short, I haven't been working on IDEA - at least not constantly -
    as I've been developing Eclipse RCP products and plugins starting from April 2021, with a development stack
    that isn't what you'd look for nowadays. The products' VCS, Rational Team Concert, isn't supported
    at all in IDEA (I did open a ticket for IBM in 2018), so that ruled out completely the possibility of using it.
  </p>
  <p>
    Other than that, I was burned-out and just thinking about committing to GitHub made me really uncomfortable.
    I kept postponing forever in favor of playing Call of Duty (gotta admit that). Maybe I was feeling a bit down,
    or maybe I was stressed out too much.
    <br/>
    I hope this shed some light on what was going on during these last months, and it's indeed my fault
    if I haven't answered issues or pull requests.
  </p>
  <p>
    Some of you emailed me directly, and I really appreciated it. My email (<code>lp.edoardo@gmail.com</code>) is always open,
    so if you notice I'm not answering on GitHub, you're welcome to forward your issues there too!
    <br/>
    I'd like to thank everyone who still visited the repository to report issues or to try to fix what I wasn't able to fix
    myself.
  </p>
  <h1>Compatibility with IDEA 2022.*</h1>
  <p>
    The biggest change that comes with this release is compatibility with IDEA 2022.*. As I was mentioning in
    previous <i>What's new</i> pages, my goal is to keep supporting as many Platform's versions as possible,
    so that people with older IDEs are still able to enjoy using Conventional Commits.
  </p>
  <p>
    Unfortunately, each new version increases the odds of unexpected behaviors, which can obviously
    only be observed at runtime. For your interest, I'm using a special annotation,
    <a href="https://github.com/lppedd/idea-conventional-commit/blob/master/src/main/kotlin/com/github/lppedd/cc/annotation/Compatibility.kt">@Compatibility</a>,
    to document code that is written for the specific purpose of supporting every possible version.
    <br/>
    Have a look at its usages if you want.
  </p>
  <h1>Fixes in 0.20.1</h1>
  <p>This minor release fixes a couple of issues, specifically:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="https://github.com/lppedd/idea-conventional-commit/issues/70">Issue #70</a><br/>
      Using the tab key inside the commit panel was producing an exception since, probably, the latest 2021.3 versions.
      Why? Well, the commit's text editor needs to handle the tab key differently from all the other text editors
      (e.g. to easily navigate the <i>scope</i> token), so a custom handler is injected. That handler was in fact trying
      to do something which would result in a deadlock, and the Platform was stopping it before it would happen.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://github.com/lppedd/idea-conventional-commit/issues/64">Issue #64</a><br/>
      Sometimes the VCS token provider would try to access a deleted repository root.
      Why? As you may know, direct modifications to the file system are not immediately reflected inside IDEA,
      and that means a non-existent repository root might be still valid for the IDE.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h1>Quick Documentation issues (Platform)</h1>
  <p>
    The Quick Documentation component seems to not be stable anymore since the beginning of 2021.
    We currently have an <a href="https://github.com/lppedd/idea-conventional-commit/issues/57">issue</a> opened for this,
    but beware this is in fact a Platform problem.
