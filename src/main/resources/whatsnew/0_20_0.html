  <h1>Apologies</h1>
  <p>
    Many of you probably asked themselves why I haven't been updating this plugin as frequently as I did in the past.
  </p>
  <p>
    Well, long story short, I haven't been working on IDEA - at least not constantly -
    as I've been developing Eclipse RCP products and plugins starting from April 2021, with a development stack
    that isn't what you'd look for nowadays. The products' VCS, Rational Team Concert, isn't supported
    at all in IDEA (I did open a ticket for IBM in 2018), so that ruled out completely the possibility of using it.
  </p>
  <p>
    Other than that, I was burned-out and just thinking about committing to GitHub made me really unconformable.
    I kept postponing forever in favor of playing Call of Duty (gotta admit that). Maybe I was feeling a bit down,
    or maybe I was stressed out too much.
    <br/>
    I hope this shed some light on what was going on during these last months, and it's indeed my fault
    if I haven't answered issues or pull requests.
  </p>
  <p>
    Some of you emailed me directly, and I really appreciated it. My email (<code>lp.edoardo@gmail.com</code>) is always open,
    so if you notice I'm not answering on GitHub, you're welcome to forward your issues there too!
    <br/>
    I'd like to thank everyone who still visited the repository to report issues or to try to fix what I wasn't able to fix myself.
  </p>
  <h1>Compatibility with IDEA 2022.*</h1>
  <p>
    The biggest change that comes with this release is compatibility with IDEA 2022.*. As I was mentioning in
    previous <i>What's new</i> pages, my goal is to keep supporting as many Platform's versions as possible,
    so that people with older IDEs are still able to enjoy using Conventional Commits.
  </p>
  <p>
    Unfortunately, each new version increases the odds of unexpected behaviors, which can obviously
    only be observed at runtime. For your interest, I'm using a special annotation,
    <a href="https://github.com/lppedd/idea-conventional-commit/blob/master/src/main/kotlin/com/github/lppedd/cc/annotation/Compatibility.kt">@Compatibility</a>,
    to document code that is written for the specific purpose of supporting every possible version.
    <br/>
    Have a look at its usages if you want.
