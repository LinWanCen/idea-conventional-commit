  <h1>New tokens Providers</h1>
  <p>Here we are with another feature-packed update!</p>
  <p>
    The <a href="https://github.com/lppedd/idea-conventional-commit/issues/35">feedback issue</a> had some success.
    Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/Gerrit-K">Gerrit-K</a> suggestion we have now replaced the old
    <i>Default - VCS</i> Provider with a <i>Recently used</i> one and a <i>VCS</i> one.
  </p>
  <p>
    The <i>Recently used</i> Provider reads tokens from the recent commit messages cache, and if it
    doesn't find enough tokens it falls back to the active VCS repositories filtering the commits made by yourself.<br/>
    The <i>VCS</i> Provider reads tokens strictly from VCS repositories, without any filter so that you can
    pick whatever a friend or colleague wrote down.
  </p>
  <p>
    Don't worry about performance as what's needed is cached at the appropriate time to offer a snappy
    completion experience. Beware reading from VCS repositories is <b>still experimental</b>,
    so if you encounter issues you're able to disable it by unchecking the
  </p>

  <p>
    Registry key.

  <h1>Changes in 0.17.0</h1>
  <p>
    Other than the new Providers, this release brings small features, a couple of fixes,
    and as always an extensive refactoring of the codebase.<br/>
    Following is a short summary, but you can look at all the commits
    <a href="https://github.com/lppedd/idea-conventional-commit/compare/0.16.1...0.17.0">here</a>.
  </p>
  <!-- FEATURES -->
  <p><b>Features:</b></p>
  <p class="indented">
    &#8226; implemented two new tokens Providers that are able to offer <i>Recently used</i> tokens
    and <i>VCS</i>-extracted tokens.
  </p>
  <p class="indented">
    &#8226; cleaned-up the commit message even when template completion is canceled (deliberately or by accident).
  </p>
  <p class="indented">
    &#8226; included by default the <code>Refs</code> footer type.
  </p>
  <!-- FIXES -->
  <p><b>Fixes:</b></p>
  <p class="indented">
    &#8226; deduplicated completion popup's items based on Providers ordering.
  </p>
  <p class="indented">
    &#8226; removed a memory leak when the Providers settings panel was opened without first
    going through the main panel.
  </p>
  <p class="indented">
    &#8226; correctly scaled the What's New dialog tabs and icon when a user changes scaling value while
    the dialog is displayed.
  </p>
  <p class="indented">
    &#8226; correctly calculated the checkbox column width on row insertion when the Co-authors table is empty.
  </p>
  <!-- REFACTORINGS -->
  <p><b>Refactorings:</b></p>
  <p class="indented">
    &#8226; updated the UI style of the Co-authors table to reflect the changes made in 0.16.0.
  </p>
  <p class="indented">
    &#8226; improved the SVG icons.
  </p>
  <h1>What's next?</h1>
  <p>
    As stated in the previous release changelog, I'm focusing mainly on the features we already have.
    However I'd like to provide a way to disable a Provider as currently this is impossible, if not
    by disabling plugins in case of third-party ones.
    And obviously I'll continue cleaning-up the code and fixing issues if required!
