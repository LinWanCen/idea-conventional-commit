  <h1>API changes</h1>
  <p>
    The entire plugin extensions' API has been rewritten taking into account long term maintenance cost,
    possible future changes, and interoperability between JVM languages.
    The API is now exposed as a set of well documented interfaces only.
  </p>
  <h1>Deprecation of Commitlint and Angular support</h1>
  <p>
    Sadly, I came to the realization that I can't support the Core plugin and multiple extensions, as separate plugins, too.
    The added work is too much as of now, mostly because Conventional Commit hasn't reached a stable state yet,
    and I tend to break the API now and then (although I'll try not to anymore).
  </p>
  <p>
    I've published another release of Commitlint Conventional Commit - <code>0.1.3</code> - which supports the new Core API.
    That's going to be the last supported one.
  </p>
  <p>
    Angular Conventional Commit development is already stalled since months and the last supported
    Platform version is 2020.3. Like Commitlint, there won't be new releases in the future.
  </p>
  <h1>Going forward, a.k.a. future plans</h1>
  <p>
    But hey, deprecation doesn't mean these extensions are dead forever.<br/>
    Development of Conventional Commit as an IDE plugin started in late 2019, as a simple tool to help
    colleagues write better and standardized commit messages (the first version spawned a live template only!).
    Since then, I've provided many new features each release, while also exploring the IntelliJ Platform codebase and ecosystem,
    and having fun after all.
  </p>
  <p>
    While the plugin was growing in features, and as I was seeing a big interest in the Conventional Commits standard,
    I decided to publish the sources on GitHub, and offer it to everyone through the Marketplace.<br/>
    Up until now I see about 50 thousands total unique downloads, so it seems it was a good idea, and I couldn't be happier.
  </p>
  <p>
    The mindset I've applied while writing the plugin's code has always been the same: developers should focus only
    on code, everything else should be done through tooling to save time and mental workload. Even a minute every day is
    important, and we commit <strong>a lot</strong> of times during the day. (And in general I hate CLIs, but don't tell anyone).
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>What are the future plans?</strong><br/>
    A key aspect of this plugin is that it is open source, free of charge, and extensible. Going forward I'd like to keep
    the Core plugin as it is, I'd like to keep improving it with users' feedback and suggestions.<br/>
    However, I'd also like to offer another version, on top of the Core codebase, that includes additional and feature-rich
    extensions (e.g. for GitHub, GitLab, Jira, Angular, Commitlint). And that would be a paid version.<br/>
    Why? First of all, if this idea will move forward, I really don't plan in asking for more than an Italian coffee per month.
    But the reasons are a couple: a revenue, even if small, is a motivation to keep coding and improving things.
    Also, I'm starting another job in another city, so an additional income would be helpful in paying for accommodation.
  </p>
  <p>
    I wanted to share plans so that the community could answer with useful feedback. To do that, simply use
    <a href="https://github.com/lppedd/idea-conventional-commit/discussions/87">this feedback discussion</a> on GitHub.
    I'm looking forward to reading your opinions or suggestions!

  <h1>Quality of life improvements</h1>
  <p>
    This release solves some long outstanding issues that interfered with productivity.
  </p>
  <p>
    The logic behind recently used tokens has been completely rewritten. The old "Recently used" tokens' Provider
    has been removed, and now tokens of any Provider can be categorized and weighed as <i>recent</i>.
    Also, the token's text and description (the one you see in the documentation popup) remain intact.<br/>
    A new option - <i>Prioritize recently used tokens</i> - has been added and is on by default.
  </p>
  <p>
    When you need custom tokens, you're able to use a custom <code>conventionalcommit.json</code> file in the project's
    root folder, or to set a specific path to it. However, it is not immediately clear how that JSON file should be written.
    To solve the issue, the plugin now provides an embedded JSON Schema that is automatically associated to the file,
    or that you can easily find in the JSON Schema chooser popup under the <i>Conventional Commit</i> name.
  </p>
  <p>
    Automatic insertion of a space after inputting a colon (<code>:</code>) is nice, most of the time.
    If a user is accustomed to writing a commit message without looking at the screen, it's important
    to avoid unexpected behaviors, such as inserting a space.<br/>
    The automatic insertion can be turned off via the new option <i>Automatically insert a space after the colon</i>.<br/>
    It might not be perfect, so please report issues, if any.
  </p>
  <h1>Conventional Commits as a language</h1>
  <p>
    Big news! Conventional Commits is officially a language in IDEA. I've implemented a lexer and a basic parser
    which, as a starting point, provide syntax highlighting of tokens. Highlighting colors can obviously be customized
    via <i>Editor > Color Scheme > Conventional Commit</i>.<br/>
    The language injection in the commit panel can be toggled via the new option <i>Highlight syntax</i>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Looking ahead, having a full-fledged language means many new features can be added. As an example,
    other languages can be injected when writing code snippets in the message body.
    It also becomes easier to provide inspections and other minor details that works with PSI/AST tree.
  </p>
