  <h1>Towards 1.0 and a plea to users</h1>
  <p>First and foremost, I hope you don't mind the long text!</p>
  <p>
    As some of you may have noticed, the updates cadence has decreased lately.
    Not because I don't have time (well, maybe) but because the features and bug-fixes
    I'm facing are pretty hard to implement or to investigate and fix while also
    maintaining compatibility with IDEA 2019.2+.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is where <strong>all of you</strong> come in to play!
    Please report any sort of issue you encounter in completion, settings, UI,
    and let me know about any idea of feature which could benefit everyone.
    I'm especially interested in your answers to a couple questions:
  </p>
  <p class="indented">
    &#8226; what's your IDE release (e.g. 2020.1)?<br/>
    &#8226; are you using template completion?<br/>
    &#8226; what's the most useless feature you encountered?
  </p>
  <p>
    I've opened a <a href="https://github.com/lppedd/idea-conventional-commit/issues/35">feedback issue</a>
    on GitHub where you can write whatever you want.<br/>
    And if you don't own a GitHub account, please contact me at <code>lp.edoardo(at)gmail.com</code>
  </p>
  <p>
    With this in mind, I hope by the beginning of the new year we'll have the first
    stable version.
  </p>
  <h1>Changes in 0.16.0</h1>
  <p>
    This release packs more then 100 commits which include new features, extensive refactorings,
    and bug fixes. Following is a short but comprehensive summary.
  </p>
  <!-- FEATURES -->
  <p><strong>Features:</strong></p>
  <p class="indented">
    &#8226; differentiated the token's displayed value (in completion popup) from its real value.<br/>
    This enhancement seems like a small detail, but it's huge as it let's us search an item by a comprehensible
    text while outputting another value. Think about a GitHub issue: you search via its title but
    want its number to be inserted.
  </p>
  <p class="indented">
    &#8226; allowed using a custom Co-authors file.<br/>
    The co-authors file is created/picked-up from the project's base directory; however with this enhancement
    you're also able to select a file using an absolute path.
  </p>
  <p class="indented">
    &#8226; allowed sorting body, footer type, and footer value tokens.<br/>
    This is accessible via the <em>Settings > Conventional Commit > Providers</em> tab.
  </p>
  <p class="indented">
    &#8226; displayed changelogs/news inside a dedicated dialog (this very dialog!) and expose a public API.
    Even extensions are able to add their own tabs.
  </p>
  <p class="indented">
    &#8226; preselected the top item in completion's popup when using <em>context completion</em>.<br/>
    This change removes the need to use the down-arrow key to begin selecting items,
    so that you can immediately complete.<br/>
    Should this be optional? Let me know in the <a href="https://github.com/lppedd/idea-conventional-commit/issues/35">feedback issue</a>.
  </p>
  <p class="indented">
    &#8226; cleaned-up whatever the plugin created if it is uninstalled.<br/>
    Currently only some non-roamable properties are removed, but this will be expanded in the future if necessary.
  </p>
  <!-- FIXES -->
  <p><strong>Fixes:</strong></p>
  <p class="indented">
    &#8226; used the correct project's base path.<br/>
    Probably from 2020.3, the platform API started returning the <code>.idea</code> folder as the project's base path.
    This is obviously wrong and hinders the auto-discovery of the default tokens file (<code>conventionalcommit.json</code>)
    and of the Co-authors file (<code>conventionalcommit.coauthors</code>).
  </p>
  <p class="indented">
    &#8226; allowed commit message reformatting using keys shortcut in 2020.2+<br/>
    This is a platform problem (<a href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-254830">IDEA-254830</a>) but I managed
    to workaround it.
  </p>
  <!-- REFACTORINGS -->
  <p><strong>Refactorings:</strong></p>
  <p class="indented">
    &#8226; improved the completion process.<br/>
    In conjunction with the first mentioned feature, I've replaced the underlying code that performs the completion item
    insertion. That is now smarter and lighter, but <strong>there might be issues, so report them in case</strong>.
  </p>
  <p class="indented">
    &#8226; improved the UI.<br/>
    The user interface now strictly follows the platform guidelines (and even goes beyond)
    aiming at offering the best possible user experience.<br/>
    Scaling of panels and controls is taken into account everywhere to ease working with big monitors
    and higher resolutions.
  </p>
  <h1>Future plans</h1>
  <p>
    Until the end of the year I would like to focus on the features we already have, and on bug fixes if required.
    This doesn't mean I don't want to add new things, but that to be considered they
    must provide good value.<br/>
    What I already planned:
  </p>
  <p class="indented">
    <strong>&#8226; work on new extensions! I've already written a POC for GitHub issues integration.</strong>
  </p>
  <p class="indented">&#8226; handle more edge cases in completion.</p>
  <p class="indented">
    &#8226; stabilize and document the exposed API.<br/>
    This will allow more third-party extensions to become available.
  </p>
  <p class="indented">
    &#8226; clean-up the code and add in-code documentation to attract contributors.<br/>
    I'm already doing this, but it's a never ending task.
  </p>
  <p class="indented">
    &#8226; investigate improvements for the What's New dialog.<br/>
    Currently I'm using a Swing embedded browser, however I would like to move to a native Swing component.
  </p>

    <h2>Contributors</h2>
    <p>
      I'd like to thank <a href="https://github.com/ymind">ymind</a> for the
      Chinese localization, all the people who tried out the plugin,
      and the ones who submitted issues during the months.
