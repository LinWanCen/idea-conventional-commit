<p>
    The aim of this plugin is to provide completion for
    <a href="https://conventionalcommits.org">conventional commits</a>,
    also named <i>semantic</i> commits, inside the VCS Commit dialog.
</p>
<br/>
<p>The plugin provides:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Standard completion - based on context</li>
    <li>Template completion - initiated intentionally</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<p>
    It also offers a certain level of customization, which means allowing personalized,
    sharable, default tokens and attaching additional <i>providers</i> for the various
    parts of the commit: type, scope and subject.
