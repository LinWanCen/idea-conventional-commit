  The aim of this plugin is to provide completion for
  <a href="https://conventionalcommits.org">conventional commits</a>,
  also named <i>semantic commits</i>, inside the VCS Commit dialog.
</p>
<br/>
<p>The plugin provides:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Standard completion - based on context</li>
  <li>Template completion - initiated intentionally</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<p>
  It also offers a certain level of customization, which means allowing personalized and
  sharable default tokens, and attaching additional <i>Provider</i>s for the various
  parts of the commit message: <b>type</b>, <b>scope</b>, <b>subject</b>, <b>body</b>,
  <b>footer type</b> and <b>footer value</b>.
