The aim of this plugin is to provide completion for conventional commits, also named "semantic" commits,
inside the VCS Commit dialog.
  
The plugin must provide

 - Standard completion, based on context
 - Template completion, invoked intentionally
 - Extensibility, which means allowing attaching providers for the various parts of the commit:  
   _TYPE_, _SCOPE_, _SUBJECT_
  
#### Example
