<h3>0.12.0 (10/04/2020)</h3>
<p>
  Nineteenth alpha release.<br/>
  Feature, fixes and refactoring
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    In a mission to have parity of behavior for context and template completion, I've enhanced
    the template completion with a step for body/footer types.<br>
    You'll also notice the scope parentheses, if empty, aren't removed as soon as you complete them;
    this change means you'll be able to go back and forth on all segments. Also,
    after template's completion the core engine will reposition the cursor and delete the empty
    scope's parentheses.<br>
    You can follow <a href="https://github.com/lppedd/idea-conventional-commit/issues/25">issue 25</a>
    for other future changes. The work to do is <strong>a lot!</strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed the jerky new experimental on-the-fly filtering of completion elements. This took
    an enormous effort, as I had to debug the completion mechanism and hook in the right places.<br>
    The filtering behavior will for sure be enhanced again in the future, per your issues or requests
  </li>
  <li>
    Used safe methods to submit work eligible for cancellation
  </li>
</ul>
