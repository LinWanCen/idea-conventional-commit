<h3>0.14.0 (13/04/2020)</h3>
<p>
  twenty-first alpha release.<br/>
  Features and refactoring
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Implemented a new Provider's filter type, which allow to "keep only selected" Provider</li>
  <li>
    Allowed changing completion type (Standard / Template) and Provider's filter type
    (Keep selected / Hide selected) from the completion pop-up's menu. No need to open Settings
    for that from now on! ;)
  </li>
  <li>For template completion, refactored the "No scope" element to behave better</li>
</ul>
