<h3>0.18.0 (05/02/2021)</h3>
<p>
  Thirtieth alpha release.<br/>
  Features and refactorings
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Implemented a new "naming convention" inspection that highlights illegal symbols in commit's type and scope,
    based on RegExp patterns defined under <b>Version Control > Commit > Commit message inspections</b>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Relaxed commit's tokens pattern rules in JSON Schema and associated parser
    to allow a wide range of UTF-8 symbols.
  </li>
  <li>
    Reworked commit's inspections registration to avoid Reflection and bytecode manipulation,
    thus removing the need for CGLIB.
  </li>
  <li>Cleaned-up the source code.</li>
</ul>
