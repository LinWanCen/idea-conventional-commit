<h3>0.8.2 (02/04/2020)</h3>
<p>
  Thirteenth alpha release.<br/>
  New Provider, fix and refactoring
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Landed a new Provider which extract commit types and scopes from <strong>Commitlint</strong> rules!<br>
    You can find it at <a href="https://github.com/lppedd/idea-conventional-commit-commitlint">Commitlint Conventional Commit</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed Provider's icons rendering in the Providers settings page.<br>
    To maintain a good looking UI I ask Provider implementations to use
    <code>16x16</code> or <code>32x32</code> icons. Unfortunately I did not consider scaling
  </li>
  <li>
    Omitted commit subjects during footer value's completion, and offer completion items
    based on the footer type
  </li>
</ul>
