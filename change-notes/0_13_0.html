<h3>0.13.0 (11/04/2020)</h3>
<p>
  Twentieth alpha release.<br/>
  Feature, fix and refactoring
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Talking about template completion, as you can see
    <a href="https://github.com/lppedd/idea-conventional-commit/issues/25">issue 25</a>
    is <strong>closed</strong>! The entire code which power template completion has been
    rewritten to use the context completion's contributor, so the engine is the same now.<br>
    Because of this <strong>feature disparity shouldn't be a thing anymore</strong>!
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed the handling of the "template state" for inspections. In fact inspections are
    able to call a <code>isTemplateActive</code> method and react accordingly.
  </li>
</ul>
