  New feature, refactoring and fix

    Provided a way to filter out a Provider's completion items directly from the
    completion's popup.

    <br>
    <em>As of now, if you change the search term, the filters are going to be reset.</em>
    <br>
    <br>
    This experimental feature brought a massive code update (+ 1300 LOC),
    and laid the foundation for Provider's parallel execution. In fact the items are no more
    ordered thanks to pre-ordering Provider's, but only thanks to a weighing system,
    which updates them as they come in.
