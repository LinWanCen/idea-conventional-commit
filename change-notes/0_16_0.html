<h3>0.16.0 (10/11/2020)</h3>
<p>
  Twenty-sixth alpha release.<br/>
  Features, fixes and refactorings:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Differentiated the token's displayed value (in completion popup) from its real value.<br/>
    This enhancement seems like a small detail, but it's huge as it let's us search an item by a comprehensible
    text while outputting another value. Think about a GitHub issue: you search via its title but
    want its number to be inserted.
  </li>
  <li>
    Allowed using a custom Co-authors file.<br/>
    The co-authors file is created/picked-up from the project's base directory; however with this enhancement
    you're also able to select a file using an absolute path.
  </li>
  <li>
    Allowed sorting body, footer type, and footer value tokens.
    This is accessible via the <code>Settings > Conventional Commit > Providers</code> tab.
  </li>
  <li>
    Displayed changelogs/news inside a dedicated dialog (this very dialog!) and expose a public API.
    Even extensions are able to add their own tabs.
  </li>
  <li>
    Preselected the top item in completion's popup when using context completion.<br/>
    This change removes the need to use the down-arrow key to begin selecting items,
    so that you can immediately complete.
  </li>
  <li>
    Cleaned-up whatever the plugin created if it is uninstalled.
    Currently only some non-roamable properties are removed, but this will be expanded in the future if necessary.
  </li>
  <li>
    Improved the completion process.<br/>
    In conjunction with the first mentioned change, I've replaced the underlying code that performs the completion item
    insertion. That is now smarter and lighter, but <strong>there might be issues, so report them in case</strong>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Improved the UI.<br/>
    The user interface now strictly follows the platform guidelines (and even goes beyond)
    aiming at offering the best possible user experience.
    Scaling of panels and controls is taken into account everywhere to ease working with big monitors
    and higher resolutions.
  </li>
  <li>
    Used the correct project's base path.<br/>
    Probably from 2020.3, the platform API started returning the <code>.idea</code> folder as the project's base path.
    This is obviously wrong and hinders the auto-discovery of the default tokens file and of the Co-authors file.
  </li>
  <li>
    Allowed commit message reformatting using keys shortcut in 2020.2+.
    This is a platform problem (<a href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-254830">IDEA-254830</a>) but I managed
    to workaround it.
  </li>
  <li>Done an extensive code clean-up.</li>
</ul>
